    <string name="Mercury">Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our Solar System. With a cratered, Moon-like surface and no significant atmosphere,it experiences extreme temperatures between day and night. Its long days and rapid orbital period make its rotation quite unique. Despite being so close to the Sun, it\'s not the hottest planet.</string>
    <string name="Venus">Venus is often called Earth\'s twin due to its similar size and composition, but it\'s covered in thick clouds of carbon dioxide that trap heat, making it the hottest planet. It\'s surface is rocky and volcanic, and it rotates very slowly, even backward compared to most other planets.</string>
    <string name="Earth">Earth is the only planet known to support life, thanks to its liquid water, magnetic field, and breathable atmosphere. It has a diverse environment with oceans, forests, and mountains, and one natural satellite the Moon. Earth’s climate and ecosystems make it uniquely habitable.</string>
    <string name="Mars">Mars, the Red Planet, has a dry, dusty surface covered in iron oxide. It features the tallest volcano and deepest canyon in the Solar System. While it’s cold and thin-aired, signs of ancient water suggest Mars may once have supported life and remains a key target for exploration.</string>
    <string name="Jupiter">Jupiter is the largest planet, a massive gas giant with a violent atmosphere and a famous storm the Great Red Spot. It has over 90 moons, including Ganymede, the biggest moon in the Solar System. Its rapid rotation causes noticeable flattening at the poles. </string>
    <string name="Saturn">Saturn is known for its stunning rings made of ice and rock particles. It’s a gas giant like Jupiter, but less dense it would float in water. Saturn has more than 140 moons, with Titan being one of the most Earth-like bodies due to its thick atmosphere and methane lakes.</string>
    <string name="Neptune">Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and an ice giant with deep blue coloring due to methane. It has incredibly strong winds the fastest in the Solar System and a dynamic atmosphere. Its moon Triton is geologically active and orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune\'s rotation.</string>
    <string name="Uranus">Uranus is an icy blue planet that rolls on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees. It has a cold atmosphere composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Uranus has faint rings and dozens of moons, and it experiences extremely long seasons.</string>
    <string name="Pluto">Pluto, once the ninth planet, is now classified as a dwarf planet. It orbits in the Kuiper Belt and has a thin atmosphere that appears when it\'s closest to the Sun. Despite its small size, Pluto has mountains, plains, and even glaciers, making it a fascinating world to study.</string>

    <string name="moon_luna">Luna, Earth\'s only natural satellite, is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system. Its cratered surface has inspired myths and science alike, and it plays a crucial role in Earth\'s tides and night sky.</string>
    <string name="moon_phobos">Phobos is the larger and closer of Mars\' two moons. Irregular in shape and full of craters, it orbits Mars faster than the planet rotates, rising in the west and setting in the east within hours.</string>
    <string name="moon_europa">Europa is one of Jupiter\'s Galilean moons, known for its smooth, icy surface. Scientists believe a vast ocean lies beneath its crust, making it one of the most promising places to search for alien life.</string>
    <string name="moon_io">Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Covered with sulfur and constantly reshaped by eruptions, it orbits Jupiter and is locked in a gravitational tug with Europa and Ganymede.</string>
    <string name="moon_ganymede">Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system—even bigger than Mercury. It has its own magnetic field and a surface of ice and rock, with possible subsurface oceans deep below.</string>
    <string name="moon_callisto">Callisto, another of Jupiter\'s major moons, is heavily cratered and ancient. Its dark, icy surface shows little geologic activity, but it might harbor a subsurface ocean as well.</string>
    <string name="moon_titan">Titan is Saturn\'s largest moon and is enveloped in a thick, hazy atmosphere. It features lakes and rivers of methane and ethane, making it one of the most Earth-like environments in the solar system.</string>
    <string name="moon_enceladus">Enceladus is a small, icy moon of Saturn that erupts plumes of water vapor from its south pole. Beneath its frozen surface lies a global ocean, fueling speculation about alien microbes.</string>
    <string name="moon_triton">Triton, Neptune\'s largest moon, orbits in the opposite direction of the planet\'s rotation—a rare trait. It has geysers of nitrogen and is likely a captured object from the Kuiper Belt.</string>
    <string name="moon_charon">Charon is Pluto\'s largest moon and is so big relative to its planet that the two bodies orbit a shared center of gravity. Its surface is marked by canyons, mountains, and icy plains.</string>

    <string name="asteroid_ceres">Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It\'s also classified as a dwarf planet, with evidence of water ice beneath its surface and possible signs of past geological activity.</string>
    <string name="asteroid_vesta">Vesta is one of the brightest asteroids visible from Earth. It has a rocky surface and massive impact craters, including the huge Rheasilvia basin at its south pole, likely formed by a giant collision.</string>
    <string name="asteroid_pallas">Pallas is the third-largest asteroid in the solar system. Its tilted orbit and irregular shape make it stand out, and it may be the remnant of a protoplanet that never fully formed.</string>
    <string name="asteroid_hygiea">Hygiea is a dark and round asteroid located in the outer asteroid belt. It\'s the fourth-largest object in the belt and is notable for its potential reclassification as a dwarf planet due to its shape.</string>
    <string name="asteroid_eros">Eros was the first asteroid to be orbited and landed on by a spacecraft (NEAR Shoemaker). Shaped like a peanut, it comes close to Earth and helped scientists learn about asteroid composition.</string>
    <string name="asteroid_bennu">Bennu is a near-Earth asteroid visited by NASA\'s OSIRIS-REx mission. It\'s rich in carbon and thought to be a time capsule from the early solar system, possibly containing the building blocks of life.</string>
    <string name="asteroid_ryugu">Ryugu is a diamond-shaped asteroid studied by Japan\'s Hayabusa2 mission. Its dark surface is covered in boulders, and it has a very low density, suggesting it\'s a rubble pile loosely held together.</string>
