Yes! You can enable notifications in the Settings tab to receive alerts for major events like eclipses, moon phases, or meteor showers.

10. What data do you collect?
Please review the Privacy Policy in the Settings section to understand how your data is handled.

11. How accurate is the location used for moonrise, moonset, and celestial event calculations?
The app uses your device’s GPS or network-based location to provide accurate timings for moonrise, moonset, and visibility of celestial events. If precise location access is not granted, the app will fall back to a general or last known location, which might slightly affect timing accuracy. We never store or share your location data. It's only used to enhance your sky-watching experience.
